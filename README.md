# fitzroy's Slate Pro Font

## Why This Modules?

There weren't any modules for Slate Pro font and I hate [Font Changer](https://www.github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/Fontchanger)'s interface so I extracted fonts from it's repository and made this module.

I'll probably create a project with an app to interact and change fonts and a CLI interface also with which you can change every single font within your `system/fonts` from [**Devanagari**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari) to [**Hebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet).
